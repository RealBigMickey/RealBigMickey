## Hi, I'm William Stevens👋
> CSIE student at National Cheng Kung University.

I enjoy operating systems, low level system design, and programmable routers.  
I hope to build systems that are predictable, maintainable, and grounded in tradeoffs.  

Right now I’m preparing for research roles in systems and networking.  
Feedback, positive or negative, is welcome 🙂
